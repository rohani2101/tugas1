    <b>1993-presen</b><br />
    <p>the first version of HTML was written by Timbernes-lee in 1993.since then,there
        have been many different version of HTML. The most widely used version
        throughout the 2000's was <b>HTML 4.01</b>. which became an official standard in December 199.<br /><br />
        Another version,<b>XHTML</b>,was a rewite of HTML language. XML is a
        standard markup language that is used to creat other markup languages. Hundreds
        of XML languages are in use today, including GML(Geography markup language),
        <b><i>mathML, MusicML</i></b>,and <b>RSS</b> (Really simpel syndication). Since each of these
        languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be
        shared asross applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no 
        surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again,called XHTML).
        XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was update in 2002. XHTML is 
        very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strick rules are necessary for all XML 
        languages, because without it, interoperabilly belween applications would be impossible.
        You,ll learn more aboute tehe differences belween HTML and XHTML
        in <u><i>unit 2</i></u><br /><br />
        most pages on the web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0.
        however, in recent years, the W3C (in cillaboration with another organization,the <u><i>WHATWG</i></u> ),
        has been working on a brand new version of HTML, <b>HTML5.</b>
        Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draf specification, and is not yet an official
        standard. However, it is aiready widely supported by browsers and other web- 
        enabled devices, and is the way of the future. Therefore,<b>HTML5 is the primary 
            language taught in this course </b><br /><br />
        The following table shows a list of many of the types of content that can be added to 
        web pages using different versions of HTML. in the days of the web, HTML 
        (version 1.2) was very simple, but over time new versions were released that added
        more and more features. Still, if web designers wanted to add content of features
        that HTML didn't support, they would have to do so white non-standard proprietary
        technologies such as Adoble Flash. These technologies would be unabie to 
        access the content (for example, iphones and ipadsdon'tsupport flash)
